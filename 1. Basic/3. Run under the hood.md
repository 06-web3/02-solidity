## Writing the Solidity Code

- Solidity is a high-level programming language that is specifically `designed for writing smart contracts`
- The code is `similar to JavaScript or Python`

## Compilation of the Code

- After writing the Solidity contract, it needs to be `compiled into bytecode` (machine code) that can be `understood and executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)`. The steps includes

1. `Solidity Source Code` → `Intermediate Representation (IR)`
   . The `Solidity Compiler (solc)` first `translate the human-readable code` into an `Intermediate Representation (IR)`
   . This is an `abstract form of the code` that is more optimized for the final output

2. `Intermediate Representation (IR)` → `Bytecode Generation`
   . `The IR` is then `compiled down to low-level bytecode`, which is the `actual machine-readable format` that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can execute.

3. `Additional ABI` (Application Binary Interface)
   . In `addition to the bytecode`, the compiler `also generates the ABI`, which is `a JSON`-like interface that `describes the methods and data structures` of the contract

## Send Transaction Contract Creation + EVM byte code

- `Transaction Contract Creation + EVM byte code` are sent to the blockchain and `waiting for miner for mining`
- Once `it mined`, our contract is available on the blockchain now
