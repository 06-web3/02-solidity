## calldata

- Is `read-only`, so you cannot modify the array passed through calldata
- `Gas Cost is cheaper` because it doesnâ€™t involve copying the data to storage.

## memory

- Is `read/write`, allowing you to change the array as needed
- `Gas Cost is more expensive` since it involves copying data and allows modifications
