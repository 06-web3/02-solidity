## What is smart contract?

- A smart contract is a `self-executing program` that `automates the actions` required in a `blockchain transaction`
- Smart contracts run on the `Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)`, the decentralized platform that powers Ethereum

## Pros of Smart Contracts

- `Self-Execution`
  . Once deployed on the blockchain, smart contracts `operate automatically`, `without the need` for human intervention

- `Transparency`
  . Anyone can `access and view the terms of the contract`, ensuring transparency

- `Immutability`
  . Once deployed, `no one can modify` that version, even the owner

- `Decentralization`
  . Smart contract are `not managed from any authority` or government

- `Security`
  . Data within the blockchain is `cryptographically encrypted` and `immutable`, which makes it `extremely difficult to alter` once recorded

## Const of Smart Contracts

- `Immutability`
  . If there is a `bug in the code`, a `mistake in logic`, or an `evolving business need`. It requires `creating a new contract` and migrating data, which can be `costly and complicated`.

- `Gas Fees and Costs`
  . Require users to `pay transaction fees` in the form of gas fees for executing smart contracts

- `Limitation of Storing Data`
  . Due to `gas fee`, `not much data is stored` in smart contracts
