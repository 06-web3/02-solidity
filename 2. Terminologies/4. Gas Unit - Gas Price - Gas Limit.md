## Gas Unit

- Gas is the `measurement of computational work or resources` consumed by transactions and smart contracts

## Gas Price

- Is `the amount of Ether (ETH)` that a user is `willing to pay` per `unit of gas`. It is typically `measured in Gwei`, which is a `subunit of ETH` (1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH)

- The price of gas `can fluctuate (dao động)` based on `network demand and congestion`. When the `network is busy`, users may need to `pay a higher gas price` to have their `transaction processed more quickly`

## Gas Limit

- Is the `maximum amount of gas` that a `user is willing to spend` for a particular transaction or contract execution.
- If a transaction `exceeds the gas limit`, it `will fail`, and `any changes` made by that transaction `will be reverted`, though the `gas fee will still be consumed`

## Gas Fee Calculation

- `Gas Fee` = `Gas Units` x `Gas Price`
- e.g. 21,000 x 50 Gwei = 1,050,000 Gwei = 0.00105 ETH

## Purpose of Gas

- `Preventing Spam`
  . Gas ensures that `malicious actors can't overload the network` with excessive transactions without a cost

- `Incentivizing Miners/Validators`
  . `Gas fees reward miners` (in Proof-of-Work) `or validators` (in Proof-of-Stake) for processing and confirming transactions

- `Managing Network Resources`
  . Gas helps regulate how much computational power each transaction consumes, `preventing resource abuse (lạm dụng)` and `maintaining network stability`
